Their temperament is independent and meticulous. They have a strong desire to keep themselves clean: they will lick themselves to clean and avoid dirt on their coat as much as possible. They are extremely proud and will scream if the dog is handled in a way they do not agree with. They may also do a similar scream when they are extremely happy.",

Like Xi Shi, they are beautiful with their long silky coat, often styled and decorated. The breed is playful, friendly, and calm. Unfortunately, Shih Tzu suffers from terrible health even at an early age due to incompetent breeders trying to make the 'cutest dog'. The ideal beauty of the breed's face has caused the skull to be malformed. This has lead to breathing and eye issues.",

    "description": "Dingo, an ancient dog of nearly 3500 years, is often debated whether it is a domestic dog (Canis familiaris) or its own subspecies of wolves (Canis lupus dingo). They are mostly accepted as the latter where their lineage split from its ancestors in South Eastern Asia about 8000 years ago. Dingos are more solitary than most other wolf descendant animals; their packs mostly consist of their mate and possibly with their offspring. They are strong and learn, hunting kangaroos, geese, rats, and rabbits.",
